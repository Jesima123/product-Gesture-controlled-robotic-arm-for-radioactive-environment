Today robots are dexterous, equipped for performing incredible accomplishments of designing and shows human like attributes. Robotics creates major impacts in all domains and is quickly emerging as a game changer. This project manages plan and execution of gesture controlled robotic arm. This system configuration is basically an accelerometer-based framework which controls robotic arm wirelessly by using affordable cost, three-axis degree of freedom (DOF) accelerometer through RF signal. Robotic arm is placed on a movable platform which is controlled by another accelerometer wirelessly. The accelerometer mounted on the human arm, captures its gestures and postures. The robotic arm and platform are synchronized with arm gestures and postures. The system is outfitted with an IP camera, which transfers ongoing video remotely to any web empowered devices. The comparison between methodologies is made to accomplish the current execution and to spotlight the impacts in research and development areas.
